Temporal Bias:

The top 100 songs from 2018 might reflect a specific phase or trend in the listenerâ€™s taste during that year, influenced by contemporary popular music, significant personal events, or seasonal preferences. This may not represent their overall, long-term music preferences.
Limited Data Scope:

Only having data from one year can miss broader trends or shifts in musical taste. Music preferences can change over time, so this snapshot might not be indicative of their current or more general preferences.
Popularity Influence:

The songs may be influenced by what was popular or heavily promoted in 2018, rather than purely personal choice. This might skew the profile toward mainstream trends rather than unique personal tastes.
